# IRIS — CodSoft Internship

## 🚀 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species using physical flower measurements. The project was completed as part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship, with emphasis on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and performance evaluation. It was built as part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship (Batch B71).

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)
- File: `IRIS.csv`
- Target Variable: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## 🧠 Workflow
1. Dataset loading and inspection
2. Handling categorical target values
3. Label encoding of species
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
6. Sample prediction on new input data

## 📈 Key Insights
- Iris Setosa is easily distinguishable from other species
- Petal length and petal width are the most influential features
- Logistic Regression performs effectively for multi-class classification
- Simple models can achieve high accuracy with well-structured data
